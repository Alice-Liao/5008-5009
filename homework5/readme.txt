BFS of Graph

For the provided graph below, create a C program that performs a breadth-first search algorithm starting from vertex 0. Output the vertices you encountered in order. Break ties by picking vertices in numerical order (for example, output 1 before 3).


1. Feel free to use either an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix to represent the graph.
2. Feel free to represent a vertex in an integer other than a structure.
