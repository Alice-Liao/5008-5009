Part A: Factorial of a Number:
Write an executable code in C, to print factorial of a number using recursion as demonstrated in class.
Output example for Part A:
Input the number for factorial calculation: 5

The factorial of is 120.

Part B: Reverse Linked List:
Implement a recursive algorithm that reverses a linked list using C. Your program should follow the steps below:

The linked list to be reversed from should be taken as input from the user.
Construct and print out the linked list, you can just copy paste your code from Lab 2.
Reverse the linked list using a recursive function, the function should take the head of the linked list as the parameter, and return the head of the reversed linked list.
Print out the reversed linked list.
Output example for Part B:
Input list size: 5 

Input elements of the array:

1

2

3

4

5

The list:

1 2 3 4 5

The reversed list:

5 4 3 2 1
