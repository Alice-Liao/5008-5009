Objective:
Create a C program that calculates the maximum total value of items that can be placed into a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach (tabulation).


Description:
You are given a list of items, each with a value and weight, and a knapsack with a weight capacity. Your task is to implement a function that calculates the maximum total value of items that can be placed into the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. The solution should use the bottom-up dynamic programming approach (tabulation). Node that the values, weights and weight capacity are taken as input from the user as shown below.

 

Example:

Number of items:
3 
Item values:
60 
100 
120
Item weights:
10
20
30 
Knapsack weight capacity:
50 
Answer: Maximum value:
220
 

Submission:
Implement your solution in a C file, and upload it to your repository on GitHub. Submit the link to the GitHub page containing your solution on Canvas.

 

Rubric (10 marks total):
Code compiles without any errors and delivers the correct output (7 marks)
Proper implementation of the bottom-up dynamic programming approach (3 marks)
Marks will be deducted for a late submission.
