Part A: Merge Sort

Write a C program for Merge Sort using divide-and-conquer method. Make sure you use recursion for the implementation of Merge Sort. 

Output of part A should contain the input array taken from the user and the output (sorted) array.

Example of output for part A:
Input array : 2, 10, 56, 19, -4, 5, 7, 9 
Output array: -4, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 19, 56

 

Part B: Quick Sort

Write a C program for Quick Sort using divide-and-conquer method. Make sure you use recursion for the implementation of Quick Sort. 

Output of part B should contain the input array taken from the user and the output (sorted) array.

Example of output for part B:
Input array : 2, 10, 56, 19, -4, 5, 7, 9 
Output array: -4, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 19, 56
